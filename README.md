#Daa-Project: Dense Subgraph Computation Using Network Flow
This project implements Algorithm-1 and Algorithm-4 from the paper "[Insert Paper Title Here]" to find dense subgraphs in given networks using network flow techniques. The algorithms are implemented in C++ and tested on several datasets as mentioned in the paper's experiment section.
Installation.
#Compile the code with the following command:
g++ -std=c++11 -o dense_subgraph densest_subgraph.cpp

U#sage
To run the program, ensure that the dataset files are in the same directory as the executable. Then, execute:
./dense_subgraph

Datasets
The following datasets are used in this project:

AST33.txt
netscience.txt
Ca-HepTh.txt

These files should be placed in the same directory as the executable. If you do not have these files, you can download them from [provide link or source].
