# Dense Subgraph Computation Using Network Flow

This project implements Algorithm-1 and Algorithm-4 from the paper "Dense Subgraph Computation Using Network Flow".

## Installation

To run this project, compile the code using:
g++ -std=c++11 -o dense_subgraph densest_subgraph.cpp


## Usage

1. Ensure the dataset files are in the same directory as the executable.
2. Run the program: 
./dense_subgraph 


## Datasets

The following datasets are used in this project:
- `AST33.txt`
- `netscience.txt`
- `Ca-HepTh.txt`

Place these files in the same directory as the executable before running the program.
